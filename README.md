# PyMicroservices

## Overview

This project is an example of building microservices using FastAPI and integrating continuous delivery, integration, and deployment with AWS (Amazon Web Services).

## Technologies

- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/): A modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python.
- AWS Services:
  - [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/): Virtual servers in the cloud.
  - [Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/): Managed relational database service.
  - [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/): Object storage service.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools (e.g., Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI) for automating deployments.
